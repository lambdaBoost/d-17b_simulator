# D-17b Simulator

Details for using this simulator are given in the associated youtube video.
To download the sim itself, just click on the latest release on the 'releases' tab to the left of this readme. iOS and Linux compatible versions will be added in the coming days.

I will add a comprehensive list of shortcomings my simulator has here in the next few days.
